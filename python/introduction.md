# An introduction to Python

## Motivation
  * Python is very widely used in the scientific community. Means that a lot of
    software has been written to solve problems common to our field (you can
    get more stuff done!)
  * It's used in LHCb for lots of things, particularly for writing files that
    make ntuples for you, and also for most analyses
  * Unless you are absolutely _forced_ to use C++ by external constraints, such
    as your fit program already being written in C++, use Python. It will make
    your life easier.

## Get it
* On lxplus the default is the old python 2.6.
* python 2.7 usually comes with the LCG (LHC computing grid) software, for example do
```bash
source /cvmfs/sft.cern.ch/lcg/views/LCG_87/x86_64-slc6-gcc49-opt/setup.(c)sh
```
* An easy way to get python on your computer with already many useful packages is
  to install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)

## Motivation
Does the situation depicted in [this PhD
comic](http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1531) look anything
familiar to you? What the student in this comic clearly needs (apart from some
LaTeX lessons) is a version control system! Such a system keeps a history of
project in a very non-intrusive way. The user only sees the current state of the
project in their filesystem but all changes are versioned such that previous
version are easily accessible. This reduces the need for ridiculous
`_version5.23_final` filename appendices.

Another common challenge that every physics student has to face in their time
at university is collaborative work with fellow students. Let's take a lab
course for example: You gather data, analyse it, and write a report about your
findings. There's a lot to be versioned: your data (although it will not change
after it's been recorded), your analysis programs, and the LaTeX source of your
report.

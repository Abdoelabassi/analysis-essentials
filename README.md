# LHCb analysis essentials [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lhcb/analysis-essentials.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lhcb/analysis-essentials)

This is the LHCb Starterkit, a series of lessons for getting analysts working
confidently with LHCb software. The lessons are best approached one after the
other, as most lessons build on the knowledge gained from the previous ones.

The material on this page is meant to be complementary to the excellent
[Software Carpentry lessons](https://software-carpentry.org/lessons.html) that
we will be using for the actual course. Here, we simply supply extra stuff that
we deem important for working with LHCb software.

If you have any problems or questions, you can [send an email to
`lhcb-starterkit@cern.ch`](mailto:lhcb-starterkit@cern.ch).
